# Json2xslx

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/json2xslx`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
This gem will expect an file containing JSON in it and convert it into the respective .XLS file as an exporter.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'json2xslx'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install json2xslx

## Usage

```
Json2xslx::Generator.new(["../spec/sample.json""])
```

Json2xslx can take single file containing the JSON formatted data and export it to respect .xls.
A folder of Json2xslx will be created in your home directory where you can find your exported files in various time stamp taken on running this file.

```
Json2xslx::Generator.new(["../spec/sample.json","../spec/sample1.json"], {name: "Test", path: "#{ENV['HOME']}/Json2x/"})
```

Json2xslx can take more than a single file containing the JSON formatted data and export it to respect .xls.
When more than single files are provided to the Json2xslx in order to export the .xls a single workbook with multiple sheet tabs are created.
A folder of Json2xslx will be created in your home directory where you can find your exported files in various time stamp taken on running this file.

Where to find your generated excel export:
Folder structure: home_directory/Json2xslx/time_stamp/created_file.xls


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
